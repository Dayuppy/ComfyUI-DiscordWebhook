# ComfyUI-DiscordWebhook
A very simple Discord webhook integration node for ComfyUI that lets you post images and text.

# Usage
On first use, you will need to use the "Set Discord Webhook" node to set your webhook URL. Create a blank workflow and add the two nodes from the Discord category for Set and Use Discord Webhook.

Connect them together and you should see a test image sent to your Discord channel if you configured your webhook correctly.

Delete the Set node after using to ensure that the URL is not saved within any workflow or image metadata.
